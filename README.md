# ðŸŽ¨ **Etch-a-Sketch: A Dynamic Browser-Based Drawing App**  

## **ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**  
This project is a fully interactive sketchpad inspired by the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy. The goal is to demonstrate strong DOM manipulation skills by creating a responsive grid where users can "draw" by hovering over squares. The grid size dynamically adjusts based on user input, and Flexbox ensures that the grid always fits perfectly within the container.  

## **ðŸš€ What Iâ€™ll Learn & Demonstrate**  
By completing this project, I will have gained hands-on experience in:  
- **DOM Manipulation:** Creating and modifying elements dynamically with JavaScript.  
- **Event Handling:** Using event listeners to track mouse movement and update styles.  
- **Flexbox & CSS Variables:** Structuring the grid layout dynamically to fit within a fixed container.  
- **JavaScript Functions & Loops:** Managing grid generation, user interactions, and handling dynamic input.  
- **User Experience (UX) Design:** Ensuring smooth interaction, intuitive controls, and responsiveness.  

## **ðŸ›  Features**  
âœ… **Dynamic Grid Creation:** Users can select a grid size between **1x1 and 100x100**, and the grid adjusts accordingly.  
âœ… **Hover Effect for Drawing:** The grid changes color as the user moves the mouse across squares.  
âœ… **Persistent Color Change:** Once a square is hovered over and the mouse leaves, it remains black.  
âœ… **Flexbox-Powered Grid:** Ensures the squares dynamically resize to fit the container, no matter the grid size.  
âœ… **Interactive UI:** A button allows users to change the grid size with a simple prompt.  

## **ðŸ’¡ Future Enhancements**  
ðŸ”¹ **Eraser Mode:** Ability to remove color from squares.  
ðŸ”¹ **Rainbow Mode:** Each square changes to a random color upon hover.  
ðŸ”¹ **Save Feature:** Option to download the sketch as an image.  
ðŸ”¹ **Mobile Compatibility:** Support for touch-based drawing on mobile devices.  
ðŸ”¹ **Reset Button:** Clears the grid without requiring a page refresh.  

## **ðŸŽ¯ Why This Project?**  
This project is an excellent way to deepen my understanding of front-end development by working with DOM manipulation, event-driven programming, and responsive design It also helps reinforce user interaction principles, making it a great stepping stone toward more complex web applications.

## **ðŸ”— How to Run**  
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.  
2. Hover over the grid to start drawing!  
3. Click the **"Change Grid Size"** button to create a new grid.  
4. Experiment with different grid sizes (between 1 and 100).

### **ðŸš€ Final Thoughts**  
This project showcases **how JavaScript, Flexbox, and CSS variables can work together** to create a **responsive, user-driven experience**. The **grid dynamically resizes** based on user input, and interactions feel natural thanks to event listeners.
