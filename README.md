# ðŸŽ¨ **Etch-a-Sketch: A Browser-Based Drawing App**

## **ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**
This project is a **browser-based sketchpad** inspired by the classic **Etch-a-Sketch** toy. The goal is to **demonstrate strong DOM manipulation skills** by creating an interactive grid where users can "draw" by hovering over squares. The project will involve dynamically generating elements with JavaScript, handling user interactions, and applying CSS for a smooth experience.

## **ðŸš€ What Iâ€™ll Learn & Demonstrate**
By completing this project, I will have gained hands-on experience in:
- **DOM Manipulation:** Creating and modifying elements dynamically with JavaScript.
- **Event Handling:** Using event listeners to track mouse movement and update styles.
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox:** Structuring the sketchpad and buttons efficiently.
- **JavaScript Functions & Loops:** Managing grid generation and user interactions dynamically.
- **User Experience (UX) Design:** Ensuring smooth interaction and responsiveness.

## **ðŸ›  Features**
- A **16x16 grid** that adjusts dynamically based on user input.
- **Hover effect** to simulate "drawing" on the grid.
- A **clear/reset button** to wipe the sketchpad.
- Customization options, such as **changing colors** or **adjusting grid size**.

## **ðŸ’¡ Future Enhancements**
- **Eraser mode** to remove color.
- **Rainbow mode** for a fun, randomized color effect.
- **Save feature** to download sketches as an image.
- **Mobile compatibility** to allow touch-based drawing.

## **ðŸŽ¯ Why This Project?**
This is a great way to **reinforce my JavaScript skills**, particularly in **DOM manipulation**, **event-driven programming**, and **responsive design**. It also ties into **my broader goal of mastering front-end development**, which will be useful for future projects, including potential interactive UI elements in future web applications.
